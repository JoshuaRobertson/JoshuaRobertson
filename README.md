### ðŸ¤“ Hi

- Lately I've been focusing more on animations using a combination of CSS and JS to create visually engaging UX
- I'm enjoying experimenting with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) and very impressed by how smooth it can be
- Last year I started designing SVGs and want to do more with them by utilising CSS transitions
